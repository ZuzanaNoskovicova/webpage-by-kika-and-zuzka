        <h1>What is a Webpage?</h1>
        <p>A webpage is a document or resource on the World Wide Web (WWW) that is typically written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and is accessible through a web browser. It can contain various types of content, including text, images, videos, hyperlinks, and interactive elements. Webpages are the building blocks of websites, which are collections of related webpages linked together.

When you enter a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into a web browser, it retrieves the corresponding webpage from a web server and displays it on your device. Webpages can be static, with fixed content that doesn't change, or dynamic, with content that can be updated or modified based on user interactions or external data.

Webpages are the foundation of the internet and provide a means for individuals and organizations to share information, conduct business, communicate, and offer various online services.</p>
